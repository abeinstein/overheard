Best of Overheard@UChicago
=========

Compiles the best posts (based on like counts) from [Overheard@UChicago](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2709015299/). Completed in a few hours over finals weekend, instead of studying for finals.

Maybe later I'll add:
* Graphs showing like count over time, posts over time, average likes per time of day, etc (D3 ftw)
* Random Overheard Post generator using Markov models
* Easy way to search posts
* Submit post directly from site
* Generalize to support other FB groups??? Maybe this is actually something people need for their fb groups
* Make prettier

Coders, designers, feel free to fork and contribute! I'll add build docs in the near future (after finals :-0)
